 * Write a Java class called Ellipse that reads from the user 2 integers (a and b) 
 * that represent lengths of the semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis of an ellipse.
Then calculates and prints the area of this ellipse (rounded to 1 decimal place) 
* according to the following formula:
area = Î  a b
In addition, a message indicates if the ellipse is large or small should be printed.
The ellipse is considered to be large if its area is greater than 150, 
* otherwise it is considered to be small.
